@ get9x9 subroutine
@ Retrieve the element at row r, column c of a 9x9 2D array
@   of word-size values stored using row-major ordering.
@
@ Parameters:
@   R0: address - array start address
@   R1: r - row number
@   R2: c - column number
@
@ Return:
@   R0: element at row r, column c
get9x9:
  PUSH    {LR}                      @ add any registers R4...R12 that you use

@ set9x9 subroutine
@ Set the value of the element at row r, column c of a 9x9
@   2D array of word-size values stored using row-major
@   ordering.
@
@ Parameters:
@   R0: address - array start address
@   R1: r - row number
@   R2: c - column number
@   R3: value - new word-size value for array[r][c]
@
@ Return:
@   none

@ average9x9 subroutine
@ Calculate the average value of the elements up to a distance of
@   n rows and n columns from the element at row r, column c in
@   a 9x9 2D array of word-size values. The average should include
@   the element at row r, column c.
@
@ Parameters:
@   R0: address - array start address
@   R1: r - row number
@   R2: c - column number
@   R3: n - element radius
@
@ Return:
@   R0: average value of elements

@ blur9x9 subroutine
@ Create a new 9x9 2D array in memory where each element of the new
@ array is the average value the elements, up to a distance of n
@ rows and n columns, surrounding the corresponding element in an
@ original array, also stored in memory.
@
@ Parameters:
@   R0: addressA - start address of original array
@   R1: addressB - start address of new array
@   R2: n - radius
@
@ Return:
@   none
